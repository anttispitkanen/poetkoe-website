          <h3>"Do I want to listen to this myself?"</h3>
          <p>
            That's the question I always ask myself when writing a Poetkoe song. If I don't
            want to listen to it, who else would? After all I have to listen to my songs
            over and over again while producing them, so I better like them to tolerate it.
          </p>
          <p>
            I listen to all kinds of music, so I find it natural not to limit myself to
            any single genre when making music. Some days I feel like picking up the guitar and
            kicking up the distortion, some days are for laid-back electronic soundscaping.
          </p>
          <p>
            I write, play, record, produce and publish all my music myself. I enjoy playing the guitar, bass
            and keys as well as singing or even occasional rapping. I also do all the electronics and programming
            myself. I don't play drums but I beatbox when necessary ;)
          </p>
          <p>
            Doing everything myself has a its advantages â€“ I get to have all the fun of playing every instrument!
            As Poetkoe I can also make any kinds of artistic decisions I feel like making.
          </p>
          <p>
            Not to sound too anti-social: Poetkoe is just one of the musical endeavours of mine. I have
            played in different bands doing weddings and other cover gigs for years, focusing mainly on
            vocals and keys but also occasionally guitar or bass. And our old prog-rock band Ekspansio
            in which I sing and play keys has a habbit of making a comeback gig every few years. You can check
            Ekspansio out on <a href="https://soundcloud.com/ekspansio" target="_blank">SoundCloud</a>.
